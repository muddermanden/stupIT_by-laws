stupIT_by-laws
==============

## Intention
stupIT by-laws is a repository created to support the collaborative work of adopting
ammendments.
Using github it will be easier to keep track of proposed ammendments and merge them with
the official branch if they are voted for on the general assembly.

## Usage
When creating a proposal for an ammendment just clone the repository to your own computer,
branch out and make the changes in the branch. Please provide an explanatory name for
the branch and a description of the committed changes.
